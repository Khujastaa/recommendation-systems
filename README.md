# recommendation-systems

This repository contains my personal explorations of various recommendation system techniques, ranging from traditional collaborative filtering to modern deep learning approaches. Each project includes its own dataset, methodology, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

### 1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
- Measures similarity between users to recommend new items.
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, RMSE.

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
- Focuses on similarity between items instead of users.
- Includes visualizations of item-to-item similarities.

### 3. Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- Latent factor model using Singular Value Decomposition.
- Hyperparameter tuning applied for performance optimization.

## Dataset

This project uses a subset of the [Amazon Product Ratings Dataset](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html), focusing on the **Movies and TV** category. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed for experimentation.

## Goals

- Improve recommendation accuracy using multiple algorithms.
- Understand trade-offs between different approaches.
- Build a scalable foundation for future recommender applications.

## Next Steps

- Explore deep learning-based recommendation models.
- Handle cold-start problems with hybrid approaches.
- Add interactive visual dashboards.
